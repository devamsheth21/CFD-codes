CFD- Computational Fluid Dynamics is a field pertaining to the study of Fluid flows in form of Partial Differential Equations. Here the environment in which the fluid flows is defined as a grid which can be structured or unstructured. Grids consists of nodes , so fluid can be considered to be in motion from one node to another by diffusion or by advection. Here as the nodes are defined we can find out the flux in between the nodes with the help of Slope i.e (Differentiation) . Here in CFD mostly taylor Series is implemented to obtain differentiation of the flux function in Finite Difference Method(FDM). With the help of such approximations and some linear algebra we obtain a computable equation for a flow with variable including time and x-y coordinates. 
Thus such equations are solved in form of direct linear algebra or Iterative methods such as Jacobi,Gauss elimination etc.. 
Here we have used iterative methods for solving these equations of fluid flow.
